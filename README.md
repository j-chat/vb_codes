# vb_codes
Visual Basic codes that I have created for excel automation

## Descriptions
* SelectCopy: select and copies the all non-empty rows after the table headers (the first row)
* WeekNumber: resizes the selection to the first column and then asks for a number 

## Use Cases
Semi-automate excel reporting: 
* copy and paste several excel files into one master workbook
* resizes the selection for highlighting and inputting the week number

## Results
* Reduced data collection by 30%-50%
* Macros were simple and friendly to use
