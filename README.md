# vb_codes
Visual Basic codes that I have created for excel automation

## Descriptions
* SelectCopy: select and copies the all non-empty rows after the table headers
* WeekNumber: resizes the selection to the first column and then inputs a number for that selection

## Use Cases
Semi-automate excel reporting: 
* copy and paste several excel files into one master workbook
* resizes the selection for highlighting and inputting the week number

## Results
* Reduced data collection by 30%-50%
* Macros were simple and friendly to use
